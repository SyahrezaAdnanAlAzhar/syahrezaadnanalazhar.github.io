description: "Proposed a semantic segmentation model based on the U-Net architecture, using DenseNet as the encoder and ASPP as the bottleneck module. The model was compared against existing baseline models, including DeepLabV3 with ResNet-50 and YOLOv11-M-Seg. The dataset used consisted of Indonesian food images collected through web scraping."

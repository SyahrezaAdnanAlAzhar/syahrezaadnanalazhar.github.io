title: "Dense-UNet Architecture: Indonesian Food Semantic Segmentation"
projectType: "ai"
category: "Semantic Segmentation"
image: "images/projects/dense-unet-architecture/cover.svg"
description: "Proposed a semantic segmentation model based on the U-Net architecture, using DenseNet as the encoder and ASPP as the bottleneck module. The model was compared against existing baseline models, including DeepLabV3 with ResNet-50 and YOLOv11-M-Seg. The dataset used consisted of Indonesian food images collected through web scraping."

<P>
  This is a regular paragraph. You can use <B>bold text</B> for emphasis and{" "}

<P>
  Another paragraph with different styling examples. The <B>Dense-UNet</B>
  architecture combines the benefits of <Mark>dense connections</Mark> with the{" "}

<Section title="Dataset & Its Issues">

<P>
  The dataset consisted of <B>5,000 medical images</B> with corresponding
  segmentation masks. However, we encountered several{" "}
  <Mark>data quality issues</Mark>
  that required preprocessing.
</P>

{/* Callout variants: info, warning, success, tip */}

<Callout type="warning">
  The dataset had significant class imbalance, with background pixels
  outnumbering foreground pixels by a ratio of 10:1.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  All images were normalized to 256x256 resolution before training to ensure
  consistent input dimensions.

{/* SECTION 3: TECHNICAL DECISIONS */}
{/* ========================================================================= */}

<Section title="Technical Decisions">

<P>
  We chose <B>Dense-UNet</B> over standard U-Net because dense connections
  provide <Mark>better gradient flow</Mark> and <Mark>feature reuse</Mark>
  throughout the network.
</P>

<P>
  The architecture uses <B>DenseBlocks</B> in both encoder and decoder paths,
  with <B>transition layers</B> for downsampling and upsampling operations.
</P>

<Callout type="tip">
  Dense connections reduce the number of parameters while maintaining
  representational power, making the model more efficient to train.
</Callout>

{/* ========================================================================= */}
{/* SECTION 4: EXPERIMENTAL SETUP */}
{/* ========================================================================= */}

<Section title="Experimental Setup">

<P>
  All experiments were conducted on a <B>single NVIDIA RTX 3090</B> GPU with{" "}
  <B>24GB VRAM</B>. Training was performed using the
  <Mark>Adam optimizer</Mark> with a learning rate of <Mark>1e-4</Mark>.
</P>

<Table>
  | Parameter | Value | |-----------|-------| | **Batch Size** | 16 | |
  **Learning Rate** | 1e-4 | | **Epochs** | 100 | | **Optimizer** | Adam | |

<Callout type="success">
  Our Dense-UNet achieved a Dice score of 0.923, outperforming the baseline
  U-Net by 4.2%.
</Callout>

<Table>
  | Model | Dice Score | IoU | Precision | Recall |
  |-------|------------|-----|-----------|--------| | U-Net | 0.881 | 0.792 |
  0.875 | 0.889 | | **Dense-UNet (Ours)** | **0.923** | **0.858** | **0.918** |

{/* SECTION 6: TAKEAWAYS & TRADE-OFFS */}
{/* ========================================================================= */}

<Section title="Takeaways & Trade-offs">

<Table>
  | Aspect | Advantage | Trade-off | |--------|-----------|-----------| |
  **Dense Connections** | Better gradient flow | Higher memory usage | | **Deep
  Architecture** | Captures complex features | Longer training time | | **Skip
  Connections** | Preserves spatial info | Increased model size |
</Table>

<P>
  The main <Mark>trade-off</Mark> is between <B>accuracy</B> and
  <B>computational cost</B>. Dense-UNet requires approximately
  <Mark>40% more GPU memory</Mark> than standard U-Net.
</P>

<Callout type="info">
  For resource-constrained environments, consider using a lighter backbone or
  reducing the growth rate of dense blocks.

<Section title="What I'd Do Next">

<P>
  If I were to continue this project, I would explore the following
  improvements:
</P>

<P>
  - Implement <B>mixed precision training</B> to reduce memory usage -
  Experiment with <Mark>attention mechanisms</Mark> in skip connections - Add{" "}
  <B>test-time augmentation</B> for more robust predictions - Explore{" "}
  <Mark>knowledge distillation</Mark> to create a lighter model - Benchmark on
  additional <B>medical imaging datasets</B>
</P>

<Callout type="tip">
  Future work could also explore combining Dense-UNet with transformer-based
  architectures for even better performance.

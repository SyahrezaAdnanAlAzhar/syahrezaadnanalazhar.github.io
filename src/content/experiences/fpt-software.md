## Role Description

- Designed and deployed a serverless architecture using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, and Cognito to support mobile facial landmark capture and desktop analysis workflows.
- Implemented secure mobile uploads using S3 pre-signed URLs, preventing direct bucket exposure and reducing backend processing overhead.
- Configured IAM roles with least-privilege access and Cognito-based authentication for secure API authorization.
- Designed DynamoDB schema and implemented soft-delete markers alongside S3 lifecycle policies to automatically remove corrupted/incomplete datasets, reducing storage waste.
- Independently managed infrastructure provisioning, security configuration, and system reliability as the sole backend engineer.
